<h4>Redistribution of Share Money</h4>

<p>Innovision has made a profit in the Trade Fair, which is excellent because very few JA Companies actually manage to make a profit.</p>

<p>For this reason, Innovision has decided to redistribute the money back to the shareholders.  For every share you have bought, you get HK$3 extra in return.  This represents a <strong>6% return</strong> on your investment in a 3 month period.</p>

<!-- <h4 style="color: green;">Trade Fair 2014 - A Huge Success</h4>

<p>The 2014 Trade Fair has finally come to an end, and it was a huge success.  Innovision managed to sell <strong>all</strong> of its products and make a profit, which is fantastic seeing as most JA Companies end up making a loss.  The exact amount of profit earned is still to be confirmed by Mr. Trethewey.</p>

<p>A huge thanks to all Innovision Staff for coming to the Trade Fair and putting so much effort into this event.  Without your efforts, Innovision would never have been able to sell so many of its products.  Extra credit goes to <strong>Charmaine Hui</strong> for managing the whole company and <strong>Mr. Trethewey</strong> for leading us to this success.</p>

<p><strong>However, even more important are those from Kellett who actually came to the Trade Fair and purchased something from Innovision.  Without your help and support, Innovision would not have broke even in the first place, let alone make a profit.  To repay those from Kellett who did come and support Innovision (mentally and financially), here is a game created by Innovision:</strong></p>

<!-- <p>This automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here using GitHub Flavored Markdown, select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout gh-pages
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.</p> -->

<!-- <p>We've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.</p> -->

<!-- <p>If you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named <code>gh-pages</code> to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.</p> -->
